<b><u>Instructions for using the WebQuery library</u></b>

<p>Extract the workspace zip file to a directory (you have probably already done this).</p>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline">
If you are using a language other than English</span>, you should open the VDF 17.1 Database Builder
from the Windows "Start" menu (by default under "Visual DataFlex 2012 - 17.1" -> "Development Tools").
In Database Builder from the menu choose "File" -> "Select Workspace", navigate to the WebQuery workspace and open
"WebQuery171.sws". Then from the menu select "Maintenance" -> "Reindex",
then in the dialog click "Select All", then "Reindex".
In the Reindex dialog click the lower of the two "All" buttons followed by the "Reindex" button - 
the process should only take a few seconds, after which you can close the dialogs
("OK" then "Cancel") and exit Database Builder.</p>

<p>Open the Visual DataFlex Studio (Note: if using Windows Vista or higher you should run the 
Studio via "Run as administrator") and from the menu select: "File" -> "Open Workspace",
then navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file to and open
the WebQuery171.sws file.</p>

<p>From the Studio menu select: "Project" -> "Project Properties &lt;WebApp.src&gt;",
then in the dialog, click on the "Web Application" tab and click the "Register WebApp" button
followed by "OK". When it has finished, click "OK" to close the dialog.</p>

<p>Compile and run (F5) the WebApp.src project - further instructions are available in
the application (or directly in
<a href="WebQueryUsage.html" target="blank">WebQueryUsage.html</a>), as well
as a variety of examples of how WebQuery can be employed.</p>
