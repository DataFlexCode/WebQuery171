<h2>WebQuery API</h2>

<p>WebQuery has a number of properties and messages which are intended
to be public - those are documented here.</p>

<h3>Property psCaption {<i>String</i>}</h3>

<p>This is just the standard framework property controlling what
is displayed
as the title of the WebQuery UI panel - you can set it to whatever you
like. The default is "WebQuery Definition".</p>

<h3>Property phoSessionObj {<i>Object Handle</i>}</h3>

<p>This property should contain the Object ID of the object which
controls
session management for your web application, however even if you have
customised the session management in your web app you should not need
to
modify this property setting because it defaults to the global variable
ghoWebSessionManager which you will need to have popualated with
whatever Object ID you have filling that role.</p>

<h3>Property phLoggedInFunc {<i>Boolean function reference</i>}</h3>

<p>This property defines the function which WebQuery will call to
discover
whether the current session is for a logged-in user. If you have
customised the session management within your web application to make
this different from the standard, you can tell WebQuery about it by
having a line in your web app after the "Use WebQuery.wo" line of the
form:</p>

<pre>    Set phLoggedInFunc of oWebQuery to (RefFunc(<i>YourFunctionName</i>))</pre>

<p>It defaults to <i>IsLoggedIn</i>.</p>

<h3>Property phUserNameFunc {<i>String function reference</i>}</h3>

This property defines the function which WebQuery will call to retrieve
the login name of the current session's user. If you have
customised the session management within you web application to make
this different from the standard, you can tell WebQuery about it by
having a line in your web app after the "Use WebQuery.wo" line of the
form:
<pre>    Set phUserNameFunc of oWebQuery to (RefFunc(<i>YourFunctionName</i>))</pre>

<p>It defaults to <i>psLoginName</i>.</p>

<h3>Property psOutputDirectory {<i>String</i>}</h3>

<p>This property determines where under your web app's AppHTML directory WebQuery
will write its temporary HTML files prior to sending them to the browser for
display to the user. It <u>must</u> point to a directory which is accessible to
the web server. By default it is set to "WebQuery" and will thus cause a directory
named "AppHTML/WebQuery" to be created when a report is first run.</p>

<p>The files written to
this directory are deleted as soon as they are loaded in the web browser by a
piece of JavaScript embedded in their HTML which makes a call back to the WebApp,
so this directory should always be empty.</p>

<p>This mechanism also means that users cannot "reload" reports
because as soon as they have seen them, the file on which they are based has
already been deleted - they must run the query again to see the output again.</p>

<h3>Property psStoreDirectory {<i>String</i>}</h3>

<p>This property determines where saved queries will be written to on your web
server. It should <u>not</u> be in a location accessible to the web server, but
the web application should be able to read, write and create in it.</p>

<p>By default this is set to your application's home directory (the
<i>psHome</i> property of the oApplication's phoWorkspace object) plus "WebQuery".
</p>

<p>When a user first attempts to open or save a query, this directory will be
created, along with two subdirectories: "Public" and one named for the user's
login name. Other users will then have their own directories created within it
as they use the open or save query features.</p>

<h3>Property psDownloadDirectory {<i>String</i>}</h3>

<p>This property determines where downloads (in HTML, CSV, Text or XML format)
will be written to. It should <u>not</u> be in a location accessible to the web 
server, but the web application should be able to read, write and create in it.</p>

<p>By default it is the same as <i>psStoreDirectory</i> above.<p>

<p>Files created in this directory will be sent to the user's browser as downloads
through the <i>CustomDownlLoadURL</i> mechanism of the <i>oWebResourceManager</i>
object. They will be deleted when the user clicks on the "<i>Click when done</i>"
button displayed during download operations.</p>

<h3>Property pbAllowRawOutput {<i>Boolean</i>}</h3>

<p>This property, which is false by default, determines whether "<" and ">" symbols in
the report data will be replaced in the output with their respective "HTML entities":
&amp;lt; and &amp;gt; (if false), or be output unchanged (if true).</p>

<p>Setting this to true will allow HTML embedded in the output to be sent intact
to the browser, allowing such things as HTML links and images to appear in reports.
See the sample report "Sales Person Pictures" for an example of this.</p>

<h3>Property pbUseSqlDefault {<i>Boolean</i>}</h3>

<p>This property (which defaults to False) will control the initial checked state
of the "<b>Use SQL</b>" checkbox on the Output tab. It will also control its state
following a "<b>Clear query</b>" action (i.e. if the user clicks the "Clear query"
button).</p>

<h3>Procedure ExcludeTable {<i>Table.File_Number</i>}</h3>

<p>This message takes an integer argument which is the filelist file-number of a
table to exclude from WebQuery so that the users never see it.</p>

<p>The preferred mechanism for using it is to place a line such as:</p>

<pre>    Send ExcludeTable of oWebQuery <i>tablename</i>.File_Number</pre>

<p>In your WebApp.src below the "Use WebQuery.wo" line, however for most tables
you will need to open them first, so write:</p>

<pre>
    Open <i>tablename</i>
    Send ExcludeTable of oWebQuery <i>tablename</i>.File_Number
</pre>

<p>Alternative you can simply pass the integer file number of the table within
filelist.cfg, but this mechanism will break if table numbers are changed.</p>

<p>Table whose "Description" (User Display Name) begins with an "@" character will
always be excluded from WebQuery.</p>

<p><u>Note:</u> Excluding tables will break any relational chains which pass
through them, meaning that tables they relate to will not appear in the list of
available tables if a child table of theirs is selected as the Main Table for a
query</p> 

<h3>Procedure ClearExcludedTables</h3>

<p>This message clears down WebQuery's list of excluded tables and can be used in
conjunction with the above ExcludeTable message to dynamically hide and show tables
depending on some factor(s) such as the access rights of the user.</p>

<h3>Procedure ExcludeField {<i>Table.File_Number Integer}</i></h3>

<p>This message takes two integer arguments which are the filelist file-number 
of a table and the number of a field within it to exclude from WebQuery so that
the users never see it.</p>

<p>The preferred mechanism for using it is to place a line such as:</p>

<pre>    Send ExcludeField of oWebQuery File_Field <i>tablename</i>.<i>fieldname</i></pre>

<p>In your WebApp.src below the "Use WebQuery.wo" line, however for most tables
you will need to open them first, so write:</p>

<pre>
    Open <i>tablename</i>
    Send ExcludeField of oWebQuery File_Field <i>tablename</i>.<i>fieldname</i>
</pre>

<p>Alternative you can simply pass the integer file number of the table within
filelist.cfg followed by the field number, but this mechanism will break if
table numbers or field numbers are changed.</p>

<p>Fields whose name begins with an "@" character will
always be excluded from WebQuery.</p>

<h3>Procedure ClearExcludedFields</h3>

<p>This message clears down WebQuery's list of excluded fields and can be used in
conjunction with the above ExcludeField message to dynamically hide and show fields
depending on some factor(s) such as the access rights of the user.</p>

<h3>Function PublicPath (returns string)</h3>

<p>This function returns the path of the directory in which queries have been
saved as "Public", which will be the same as:</p>

<pre>    (psOutputDirectory(oWebQuery) + "\Public")</pre>

<p><u>Note:</u> It does not guarantee that the directory actually exists yet.</p>

<h3>Function PrivatePath (returns string)</h3>

<p>This function returns the path of the directory in which queries by the
currently logged-in user have been saved as private (i.e. under "My Queries").
This will be the same as:</p>

<pre>    (psOutputDirectory(oWebQuery) + "\<i>User's Login Name</i>")</pre>

<p>If the user is not logged in it will return an empty string.</p>

<p><u>Note:</u> It does not guarantee that the directory actually exists yet.</p>

<h3>Procedure LoadAndRun {<i>String</i>}</h3>

<p>This message will cause WebQuery to load a saved query from file and
immediately run it.<p>

<p>It can be used to place predefined reports onto the menus (see the sample
reports provided under "Reports" menu in this program) or elsewhere in your
web application.</p>

<p>It takes a single argument which should be the full path and name of a saved
query, for example:</p>

<pre>
    Send LoadAndRun of oWebQuery "C:\WebQueryReports\<i>Some Report Name</i>.wqr"
</pre>

<p>You can access queries which have been saved as "public" using the technique:</p>

<pre>
    Send LoadAndRun of oWebQuery (PublicPath(oWebQuery(Self)) + "\Users List.wqr")
</pre>
