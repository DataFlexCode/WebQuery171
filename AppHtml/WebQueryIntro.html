<h2>Welcome to WebQuery</h2>

<p>(Version: 0.4 - beta 2)</p>

<p>WebQuery is an Open Source component (view) you can include in your own 
<a href="http://www.visualdataflex.com/2012" target="blank">
Visual DataFlex<sup>&reg;</sup> 17.1</a>
(or higher) WebApp programs to provide the users with an <i>ad hoc</i>
reporting capability.</p>

<p>WebQuery is a reimplemetation of <a href="http://www.stureaps.dk/" target="blank">
Sture Andersen's</a> VDFQuery Windows
utility as a VDF 17.1 WebApp Framework (WAF) component. As well as
taking its inspiration and interface design from Sture's VDFQuery, it
also relies very heavily on a number of his other offerings:
StructFunctions, TableQuery, XmlBuilder and his experimental
ExpressionParser.</p>

<p>
<b>In this program you must log in to use the WebQuery interface</b> (File
-&gt; Log In)... but who to log in as? Well, thanks to weak management,
sloppy programming and inexcusably poor product testing, a pair of
reports have been left on the Reports menu accessible to un-logged-in
users: the "Users List" will give you the required information. In
addition, some pre-defined reports require more elevated rights to
appear on the menu - again, the "Users List" will help you out here.</p>

<p>WebQuery allows you to create reports on multiple tables based on
the relationships defined in your database - once a "Main Table" has
been selected all of the tables that relates to, all the way up the
relationship tree, will be available to you. Note: you must select a
Main Table as the first step in creating a report (or load an already
defined query).</p>

<p>You can chose columns (except Overlap or Binary type columns) from
any of the tables to output and also to use as the basis for record
selection. You can also use calculated fields (expressions) and a
single selection expression. You can chose to total ("Sum") on numeric
fields and can split rows in your reports over multiple lines using the
"CR" feature, which will start a new line with that field.</p>

<p>Selections can be made using a number of selection operators,
including string inclusion or exclusion, ranges (included or excluded)
or lists of values. You can order your report by any of the main
table's defined indices, or select the "Ad hoc index" option to define
your own ordering, which can then be based on fields from related-to
tables as well as the main table. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span>:
this may result in slow
running reports.)</p>

<p>
You can define breakpoints in the report which will cause the printing
of sub-headings at the beginning of each section and sub-totals at the
end of them (the latter assuming you are totalling on at least one
field).</p>

<p>
You can specify multi-line fixed text to appear both before and after
your report.</p>

<p>
You can select the font typeface and size, specify the colours of the
text, background and alternate-row highlight (if used), choose to
include the selection critera and record count in the report, or to
print only totals. Finally you can select the output destination and
format.</p>

<p>
Reports can be saved as "Public Queries" or as private to the logged in
user.</p>

<p>
If the ability to see all of the data in the database seems too great a
capability to grant to your users, you can programmatically exclude
entire tables, or just certain columns, from being visible within the
WebQuery interface.</p>

<p>
Alternatively you can use WebQuery without making it available to your
users by omitting it from the menus (or perhaps by setting the required
rights higher than you grant them), but still use it to provide them
with reports which you build with it. There are several examples of
such reports in the "Reports" menu above (more once you log in).</p>

<p>
The data included in this sample workspace is that from the VDF 17.1
WebOrder sample (with a few additions to the WebAppUser table and some
of the customer balances adjusted to make for more interesting things
to report on).</p>

<p>WebQuery was developed entirely using the VDF Studio and required
only two minor additions to the standard Data Access Web Application
Framework. It should work with all of the four Data Access supplied
themes - Modern Sky, Windows Like, High Contrast and Web Creme - please
report any instances where it fails to do so.
</p>
